# Alien_Extermination
@author Mark_Onopchenko

This is a C++ GUI program involving SFML graphic libraries (this is why the .dll files are present in the **bin** folder).  

**src** folder contains the files with raw code of the program  
  
## Installation Steps  
**bin** folder should be extracted onto the computer in its entirety, after which, the program can be run using the **Alien_Extermination.exe** file  

Enjoy!
