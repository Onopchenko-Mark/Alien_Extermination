# Alien_Extermination
@author Mark_Onopchenko

This is a C++ GUI program involving SFML graphic libraries (this is why the .dll files are present in the 'Executable_Folder').  

'Source_Code' folder contains the files with raw code of the program  
'Executable_Folder' should be extracted onto the computer in its entirety, after which, the program can be run using the 'Alien_Extermination.exe' file  

Thank you for your time.  
Enjoy!
